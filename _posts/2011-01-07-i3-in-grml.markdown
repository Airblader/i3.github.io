title: i3 in grml
---

The most recent version 2010.12 of <a href="http://www.grml.org/">grml, a live
linux distribution for sysadmins and texttool users</a>, comes with i3 included
by default (in the GRML-FULL flavor). Just press x followed by 3 after grml has
booted to start X11 with i3.

As I am a long-time grml user myself, this makes me quite happy :). Thanks to
Mika for building such an excellent linux distribution and for encouraging me
at FrOSCon to get i3 into grml. You (and all contributors to grml) rock!

For all i3 users, this also marks an important step: There now is a live CD
(also usable on your USB thumb drive or by booting from network of course)
which comes with i3. Itâ€™s a nice way to demonstrate i3 and a lot of other
commandline tools to other people (just boot from USB).
